> YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE GREAT TO START, BUT YOU HAVE TO START TO BE GREAT. –[ZIG ZIGLAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_Ziglar)

Namaste :pray:, 

Welcome to Machine Learning Blog - A place where you will find articles/tutorials related to machine learning(ML) with Python.  The intention is to build an online resource that can serve as a knowledge base for aspiring learners.  

My name is **Mohit Sharma**, a seasoned Data Scientist who specializes in advance analytics, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. I am also a passionate trainer and have trained around 700+ students through both online and offline platforms.  

> Through this blog, I wish to share my learning with those who are interested in exploring data science or are looking out to further their knowledge of machine learning algorithms and tools. 

I understand it can be challenging, especially for beginners. When I was starting,  I remember I spent sleepless nights studying for around 8 hours after my office and did so for about nine long months that too, with my 10 to 8 job and no work from home. Everything was so confusing and challenging.

Well, honestly, I was lucky the industry was new, and topics to explore were less as compared to today. However, the scenario has changed, and today an individual is required to know so many things. Through my own experience and from the feedback of my students, I understand this is a very very difficult situation.  Most of us struggle with the following questions:

- How much math shall I dig into at the beginning of the data science career?  Is math essential for me to standout?
- Which algorithms shall I learn and how to build one's career from there?
- Where to get challenging enough dataset to solve a problem?
- How to handle interview questions? 
- What are the different roles within a data science domain?  

If you have these questions, then I request you to **bookmark this blog**. My aim through this blog is to help you gain as much knowledge as possible through simple and easy to understand theory and at times, mathematical formulas.

I am not a native English speaker and am also new to blogging. So, I may make some grammatical or spelling mistakes. If you happen to catch such an error, I request you to write back to me with suggestions or feedback. Even if you want to reach out to me for any other reason like a consultation or you are looking for personal training, or if you wish to catch up over a coffee, feel free to write back to me at datasciencebeginners@gmail.com.

Happy Learning :thumbsup:
